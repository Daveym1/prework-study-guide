# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for the prework for the front-end web developer bootcamp.

In creating this prework study guide, I want to use it to help me in my goal to becoming the best front-end web developer I can be.
As part of our prework project for the bootcamp I built this study guide to start to learn HTML, CSS, Git workflow and Javascript
I can use this study guide to help me make notes on the various aspects of the bootcamp.
I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to use Git and GitHub
